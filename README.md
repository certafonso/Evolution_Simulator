# Evolution Simulator V.1.0.
This is a program that tries to simulate the evolution of a simple being.
## How does it work?
In this version, every being has only 3 attributes:
- The quantity of food that it consumes every tick;
- The quantity of food that it produces every tick;
- The quantity of food that it has stored.

When the food stored is below 0 the being dies.

Each generation, the beings that survived the longer will reproduce (asexually) and create new mutated beings and the cycle will repeat.
